   dragon-slaying or goblin-banishing adventures.

3. In the event that this software opens a portal to another dimension or

4. If this software causes your computer to gain sentience or develop any form
   of artificial intelligence, the creators are not responsible for any
   resulting robot uprisings, technological singularity events, or spontaneous
   transformations of your computer into a helpful yet snarky sidekick.

5. The creators disclaim any warranties related to the use of this software,
   including (but not limited to) warranties regarding enchanted spells, magical

6. The creators are not liable for any misunderstandings or miscommunications
   resulting from the misspelling or misreading of "license" versus "licence."
   This includes any confusion, bewilderment, or befuddlement that may arise
   from variations in spelling, pronunciation, or interpretation of these terms
   across different languages, dialects, or dimensions. It is your
   responsibility to ensure that you fully comprehend the difference between
   these words, their meaning within the context of this Silly Unicorn License,
   and any potential magical implications or consequences thereof.
